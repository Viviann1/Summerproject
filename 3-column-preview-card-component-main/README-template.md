## Overview

I chose to keep the layout and pictures like it was, to make sure I could do it correctly.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

For me this is learning with practice, and I need to practice more and more for it to stick. Really love it even if I am not the best at it!


### Continued development

I am still totally a newbie when it comes to this, but I hope that with continue writing codes, it will be easier to do by myself without looking for help on google/Youtube.
